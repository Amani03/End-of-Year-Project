# End-of-Year-Project
End of Year Project: Reading Bus Time Prediction - A Data Science Approach. The repository includes the dissertation that gained a first mark and the Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate the approach taken using Python.

## Description of the Project
The project investigates the analysis of Reading bus times and how factors of the day can influence the predictions of arrival and departure of a bus. The intention is to draw on the data from the Reading bus history. The report will be in the form of information related to the bus, such as the service number, type of bus, the stops it takes and names, the detailed time it arrives and the expected scheduled time for arrival. The information helped to understand how the bus prediction would be studied by comparing the scheduled times to the actual arrival times that occurred on a given day. The data gathered is used to analyse further into each bus and bus stop to further understand how the time of the day could affect any possible changes to the efficiency and operation of a bus.
